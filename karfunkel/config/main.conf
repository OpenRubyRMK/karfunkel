# main.conf
#
# This is the main configuration file for Karfunkel, the OpenRubyRMK’s
# server. Do *not* remove the surrounding do..end statements.
# This file is pure Ruby code without unnecessary configuration
# limitations.
#
# Available commands are:
#
# set <OPTION>, <VALUE>
# Sets the specified OPTION to the given VALUE.
#
# enable <OPTION>
# Equivalent to `set <OPTION>, true', i.e. enables OPTION.
#
# disable <OPTION>
# Equivalent to `set <OPTION>, false', i.e. disables OPTION.
#
# define <OPTION> do ... end
# Attaches a block of Ruby code to OPTION. The structure of
# the code between `do' and `end' is option-dependent.
#
# You can refer to already set options by just using the
# option’s name, so you can do nonsense like making the
# PING request interval dependent on the port number
# by something like this:
#   set :port, 1234
#   set :ping_interval, port
#
# Default values for most options are indicated by a double
# hash sign ##.

  # Log format. The code below should be pretty self-explanatory.
  #
  # Parameter explanation:
  # * sev: Severity of the issue as a full word like "FATAL".
  # * time: The time something happened. Ruby Time object.
  # * progname: Name of the program, i.e. "karfunkel".
  # * msg: What actually happened.
  #
  # If you need the PID, you may access it as `$$' (without the
  # quotes).
