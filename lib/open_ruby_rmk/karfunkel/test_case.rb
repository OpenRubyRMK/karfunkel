#you have access to an instance of an anonymous class mixing in

#Base class for testing Karfunkel’s functionality via simulating
#requests, responses and notifications (and of course receiving
#them). In contrast to the usual unit testing defining a testcase
#works a bit different because Karfunkel’s event-driven nature
#prevents linear testing. Instead, you instanciate this class
#for your tests and call one of the test_* methods to define
#specific tests. These tests will then be called when an event of
#the type you registered for occurs. For example, you might
#define a test for the +foo+ request:
#
#  test_request :foo |req|
#    assert_equal("This is a foo", req.para1)
#  end
#
#When Karfunkel now sends you any kind of +foo+ request, this event
#handler will be called and your test will be executed.
#
#==Test Conditions
#However, an evented test like the above is triggered for *any* +foo+
#request. If you get multiple requests of this type which differ in
#their parameter structure and you want to setup different tests for
#them, you can pass a +conditions+ hash to the test_* methods. This
#conditions hash matches exactly on the request’s parameters, so
#if you expect two +foo+ requests, where the first one’s +para1+ is
#set to "This is foo" and the second one’s +para1+ to "This is foobar",
#you can setup two different tests like this:
#
#  test_request :foo, :para1 => "This is foo" do |req|
#    # Do some tests...
#  end
#
#  test_request :foo, :para1 => "This is foobar" do |req|
#    # Do some different tests...
#  end
#
#The same applices for responses and notifications, respectively.
#
#==Sending Requests, etc.
#You probably want to send requests to Karfunkel during the
#test to see if he responds correctly. You can make use of
#the #request, #requests, #response, #responses, #note, and
#the #notes methods for sending commands of the appropriate types.
#
#  request :foo, :para1 => "Some parameter value",
#                :para2 => "Some other parameter value"
#
#==Namespacing
#This class <tt>include</tt>s the OpenRubyRMK::Common namespace,
#so you don’t have to fully resolve +OpenRubyRMK::Common::Request+
#if you want to create a new request (if you refuse to use
#the helper methods described under _Sending Requests_ above)
#directly, but can just use +Request+.
#
#Furthermore, it mixes in Minitest::Assertions, providing the
#familiar test assertions such as +assert_equal+.
#
#==Initialisation and finalisation
#The Karfunkel::TestCase class provides you with four
#events related to initialisation and finalisation of
#your tests. These are, in the order in which they’re
#executed:
#
#[startup]
#  Run prior to any test, directly after the connection
#  to Karfunkel has been established. This is where you
#  want to issue a +hello+ request.
#[setup]
#  Run immediately before each test is executed. This means
#  that this code is executed the same number of times as
#  you have tests.
#[teardown]
#  Counterpart to +setup+, run immediately after each test.
#[shutdown]
#  Run after all tests have finished and the connection to
#  Karfunkel has been closed. Counterpart to +startup+.
#
#Use the #at method together with a symbol indicating the
#event you want to register for:
#
#  at :startup do
#    puts "Starting up!"
#  end
#  at :teardown do
#    puts "I've finished a test!"
#  end
#
#==Unconditional execution
#There may be times where you want to pursue Karfunkel with
#a request completely unrelated to any currently running
#communication. The easy method to achieve this is to use
#the #wait method which immediately returns and registers
#your block for execution after a specified number of seconds;
#inside this block, you can then issue your requests.
#
#  wait(10){request :foo}
#
#When the method described above doesn’t suffice, this doesn’t
#mean you’re stuck. The test client rides on top of
#EventMachine[http://rubyeventmachine.com], so you can use any
#of the vast number of methods supplied by EventMachine (indeed
#the #wait method is just a wrapper around EventMachine.add_timer).
#For instance, if you have a long-running operation and want to run
#it in the background, plus having a callback run when the operation
#has finished, you can use {EventMachine.defer}[http://eventmachine.rubyforge.org/EventMachine.html#M000486]:
#
#  longrunning_operation = lambda{your_operation_code_here}
#  callback              = lambda{|result| your_code_here}
#  EventMachine.defer(longrunning_operation, callback)
