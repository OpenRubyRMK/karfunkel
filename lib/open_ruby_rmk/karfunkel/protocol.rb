module OpenRubyRMK

  #This is a mixin module mixed into the connections made to
  #Karfunkel. The public methods are called by EventMachine,
  #the private ones are helper methods.
  #To clarify: Each time a new client connects to Karfunkel,
  #an anonymous class created and instanciated by EventMachine
  #(whatever for) and this module (as specified in the
  #core-hooked Karfunkel#start method) is mixed into that class.
  #See also the EventMachine documentation.
  #
  #== How sending and receiving works
  #After the OpenRubyRMK::Karfunkel class was instanciated,
  #Karfunkel starts listening on a port defined in the config
  #file (3141 by default). Then the following takes place:
  #
  #1. A possible client tries to establish a connection. This
  #   causes the #post_init method to be called.
  #2. #post_init instanciates the Karfunkel::Client class
  #   with the given information and adds the resulting instance
  #   to an internal array of connected clients. Then Karfunkel
  #   waits for the client to greet him. If he doesn’t greet in time
  #   (specified in the config file), Karfunkel rudely closes the
  #   connection.
  #3. The client sends a +Hello+ request. As with all sent data,
  #   this triggers the #receive_data method which in turn,
  #   when a _complete_ command has been received, calls
  #   the (private) #process_command method. (Complete commands
  #   are detected by receiving the END_OF_COMMAND byte, which
  #   should be a NUL byte.)
  #4. #process_command creates an instance of the
  #   OpenRubyRMK::Common::Command class by parsing the received XML.
  #5. If the client hasn’t been authenticated yet (as is the case
  #   when sending the first request), #process_command checks
  #   wheather the first and only request is a +Hello+ request. If this
  #   isn’t the case, the connection is immediately terminated.
  #6. Otherwise, #process_command processes each received
  #   request in turn (which in case of the first request
  #   obviously includes the +Hello+ request) and looks for a plugin
  #   that is able to handle requests of the given type. If one is found,
  #   the request is handed to the plugin for execution (Plugin#process_request).
  #   E.g., for the +Hello+ request, it finds the +Core+ plugin which
  #   currently just accepts the connection, but it could do
  #   things like password authentication.
  #7. After processing the requests, process any received responses
  #   the same way requests are processed. Any requests completely
  #   answered by responses are automatically deleted from the list
  #   of remembered requests (see the Transformator class for
  #   information on this).
  #8. Go to 5.
  #9. On disconnect, the #unbind method is called by EventMachine,
  #   which removes the client from the list of connected clients
  #   and cancels the ping timer for this client.
