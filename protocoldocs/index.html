<p>These pages describe the protocol used between the OpenRubyRMK server
component, Karfunkel, and the clients. As a user, you are most
probably not interested in this. As a plugin writer, it depends on
what exactly you want to do with your plugin. As an implementor of a
new client, this is a must-read.</p>

<p>The OpenRubyRMK protocol is a stateful two-way protocol on top of
TCP. Clients establish a connection by sending the HELLO request and,
if the server is configured accordingly, their login credentials (this
is a TODO currently).</p>

<p>The protocol is XML-based (UTF-8-encoded), and consists of four major
components:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>The request</strong>. A request is something that orders the other side of
the connection to take action somehow.</li>
  <li><strong>The response</strong>. A response is a reaction to a request; it may
either be a successful (like <code>ok</code>), an unsuccessful (like
<code>rejected</code>), or a postponing (like <code>processing</code>) response.</li>
  <li><strong>The notification</strong>. A notification is a one-way information
triggered by certain requests that cause global modifications that
all clients need to know about (like loading a project). You don’t
have to answer notifications, but a client will most likely want to
update its user interface when it receives a notification.</li>
  <li><strong>The command</strong>. A command the meta-structure sent to and from the
server. It acts as a container for any number of requests,
responses and notifications, and allows you (and Karfunkel) to sent
multiple informations in a single chunk of data.</li>
</ol>

<p>TODO: Write more docs, about request and response IDs, give examples
for actual XML, etc.</p>
